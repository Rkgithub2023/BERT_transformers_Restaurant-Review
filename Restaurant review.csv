"I enjoyed Taco Bell like it was an expensive fancy meal lol not. I went in at this location at around to try the new chile verde fries and an enchirito.  The chile verde fries were as fresh as they could get. The food was even still steaming from how hot it was. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed Taco Bell like this. The neighborhood is great, and the employees working at this location were far more mature than those of other locations I have visited in the past.  Definitely my go to place in a pinch.",4
"""Taco Bell has always been my go-to spot for a quick, satisfying meal that doesn't break the bank. Whether it's a late-night craving or a quick lunch on the go, they always deliver exactly what I'm in the mood for. The menu is packed with variety, from classic tacos and burritos to some of their more creative items like the Crunchwrap Supreme or the Doritos Locos Tacos. No matter what I order, I know it's going to be tasty, fresh, and just the right amount of indulgent.One of the things I love most about Taco Bell is how customizable everything is. I'm a huge fan of adding extra toppings or swapping ingredients to make my meal exactly how I like it, and the staff is always accommodating. Plus, the prices are unbeatable for the quality and portion sizes. Even when I'm grabbing food for a group, I can load up on a bunch of different items without spending a fortune.The service is always quick, even during the busy hours, and the food is consistently hot and fresh. I appreciate that they've also made an effort to offer vegetarian options, which makes it a great choice for everyone in my family. Whether I'm in the mood for something spicy, cheesy, or crunchy, Taco Bell has it all. It's fast food done right, and it never disappoints.""",5
"I hate this place. I ate their tacos for lunch and then I went to the bathroom and I accidently blew up my toilet. I had to call the plumber and they said they couldn't fix it because it was impossible. Your worker jerby discriminated against my dreads. I couldn't see his face because of my dreads (6'5 rich Asian gentleman by the way) The plumber scammed me out of 50 dollars and jerby scammed me out of 20 dollars and told me to square up in the parking lot. Had a very bad experience, will not be coming back. Germ out.",1
"I was here again about 3wks ago and I'm 1000% honest when I said I had the absolute BEST soft tacos I had ever had in my life from any Taco Bell. Seriously, I've been to plenty in different states in my 41yrs on earth and I'm telling you, these soft tacos were some fantastic crispy shells with some fresh and flavorful veggies and meat inside. I'm getting hungry just thinking about how good they were. I was walking home from Jackalope around 8pm on a Weds & decided to stop here to get some tacos for the road...and I'm glad I did and I look forward to doing it again.i seriously have no idea what TB was thinking making tacos this delicious because now I'm going to have extremely high expectations next time",5
