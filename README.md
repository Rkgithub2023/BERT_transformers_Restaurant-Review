<h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>This project leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model 🧠 to accurately analyze the sentiment of restaurant reviews 📝. It is built using a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face and fine-tuned for sentiment classification tasks, providing accurate and nuanced sentiment analysis from text data 🌐.</p>
    <p>The primary goal is to enhance customer feedback analysis by providing a reliable tool for sentiment classification. The system can be integrated into customer service and review monitoring applications, helping businesses understand customer sentiments and improve service quality 📊. With real-time analysis ⚡, it offers immediate insights into customer feedback, making it ideal for live monitoring and analysis scenarios.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis 🗣️:</strong> The model classifies restaurant reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, neutral, and negative, ensuring comprehensive understanding of customer opinions.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Analysis ⚡:</strong> Implements real-time sentiment analysis, providing immediate feedback and insights from customer reviews. This feature is ideal for integration into live monitoring systems or customer feedback platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup 🕷️:</strong> Scrapes live review data from restaurant websites to gather the latest customer feedback. This data is then processed for sentiment analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Live Rating Extraction ⭐:</strong> Uses BERT to determine the sentiment rating of newly scraped reviews, providing up-to-date sentiment assessments as they come in.</li>
    </ul><p>This project aims to support businesses and organizations by providing a robust tool for sentiment analysis, thereby contributing to better customer insights and improved service quality.</p>
